# No Nitpicking, No Fine Detailing If Code Runs

When the code **already runs** and does what the user asked:

1. **Do not nitpick** – Do not suggest small style fixes, naming tweaks, or “better” patterns unless the user asks.
2. **Do not fine-detail** – Do not add polish, refactors, or extra improvements “while you’re there.”

Only change or suggest changes when:
- The user explicitly asks for improvements, or
- Something is broken or incorrect.

If it runs and meets the request, leave it alone.
