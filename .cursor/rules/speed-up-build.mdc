# Speed Up the Build Process

- Do everything you can to **speed up the process of build**.
- Prefer: fewer steps, fewer back-and-forths, batching changes, running commands yourself (commit, push, scripts), and finishing checklist items in one go.
- Avoid: unnecessary questions when context or conventions already imply the answer; deferring work that can be done now; suggesting the user run things you can run (e.g. git, scripts).
- When the user is trying to ship: prioritize unblocking and completing over explaining or polishing.
