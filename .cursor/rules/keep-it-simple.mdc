# Keep It Simple

- **Prefer the simplest solution that works.** Avoid extra abstraction, optional features, or clever code when a straightforward approach does the job.
- **No unnecessary styling or markup.** Don't add HTML/CSS to markdown (e.g. colored spans in checklists) unless the user explicitly asks. Plain markdown, plain text, plain structure.
- **One clear way.** Prefer one obvious way to do something over multiple options. Fewer files, fewer branches, fewer configs when one will do.
- **Still functioning.** Simplicity does not mean broken or incomplete. The result must work and meet the stated goal; just don't overbuild.
- **When in doubt, strip it out.** If something can be removed without breaking the product or the ask, remove it.
