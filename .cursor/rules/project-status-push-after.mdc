# Project Status – Push to Git When Run or Updated

Whenever **project_status.md** is run, updated, or saved:

1. **Commit** – Stage `project_status.md`, commit with a clear message (e.g. "Update project_status.md" or a short summary of what changed).
2. **Push** – Run `git push origin main` (or the current branch) right after the commit. Do not skip the push.

**If the file is ignored:** Use `git add -f project_status.md` so it is tracked, then commit and push.

Applies when the user or the agent runs, generates, or edits project status (e.g. "run project status", "update project_status", or any edit to `project_status.md`).
