# Project Status – Push After Update

Whenever **project_status.md** is updated or saved:

1. **Commit** – Stage the file, commit with a clear message (e.g. "Update project_status.md" or a short summary of what changed).
2. **Push** – Run `git push origin main` (or the current branch) immediately after the commit so the status is double-saved on the remote.

**If the file is ignored by .gitignore:** Use `git add -f project_status.md` so it is tracked, then commit and push. Do not skip the push.

This applies when you or the user run, generate, or edit project status (e.g. "project status", "update project_status", or edits to `project_status.md`).
