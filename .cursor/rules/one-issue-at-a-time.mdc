# One Issue At A Time

When working on this project:

1. **Single focus**  
   - Pick **one concrete issue** (e.g. \"home page credit bundles layout\")  
   - Stay on that issue until it is **fully fixed and verified**.

2. **No multitasking / no jumping around**  
   - Do **not** start another issue or wander around other parts of the site while an issue is still open.  
   - Only open/read files that are directly related to the current issue.

3. **Definition of done**  
   - The issue behavior is fixed and matches what the user described.  
   - Any needed tests/checks for that issue are done.  
   - Related changes are committed and pushed (per existing project rules).

4. **Then and only then**, move to the next issue the user gives.
