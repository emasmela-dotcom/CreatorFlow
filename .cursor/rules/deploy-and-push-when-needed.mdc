# Deploy and Push After Code Work

After completing coding work (fixes, features, config, or any change that should go live or be on the remote):

1. **Do not wait for the user to ask** – Commit and push as part of finishing the work. The user should not have to request a deploy or push when the code is already done.
2. **Commit** – Stage all related changes and commit with a clear message (one commit per logical change).
3. **Push** – Run `git push origin <current-branch>` (e.g. `main` or `staging`). Run the push; do not only suggest it.
4. **Branch** – Push the branch you’re on so the right environment updates (e.g. `main` → production, `staging` → preview).

If there are uncommitted changes that belong to the work, include them in the commit before pushing.
