# Save After Accomplishments

After completing meaningful work (new features, fixes, refactors, or multi-step tasks):

1. **Ensure files are saved** – Edits are written to disk.
2. **Commit on your own** – Run a git commit with a short message that summarizes what was done (e.g. "Add select-plan page, point buttons to signup" or "Fix production URL defaults to creatorflow365.com").
3. **One commit per accomplishment** – One logical change per commit; message clear and concise.
