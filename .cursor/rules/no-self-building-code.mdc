# No Self-Building Code

When new code is needed (features, components, APIs, scripts):

1. **Do not build the full code yourself.**
2. **Explain clearly what is needed** – structure, functions, types, and behavior.
3. **Let the user fetch/generate the actual code** from an outside AI or source.
4. **Then help integrate or review** the code the user brings back (wiring it up, fixing errors, or adjusting to fit the project).

Only write or edit small glue code when absolutely necessary to:
- Wire up imports/exports,
- Fix obvious type/runtime errors,
- Or connect user-provided code to existing files.
