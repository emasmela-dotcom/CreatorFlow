# Vercel Deployment = Push to Git

Whenever a Vercel deployment is needed (so the live site at creatorflow365.com or the project’s Vercel URL gets the latest code):

1. **Commit first** – Ensure all relevant changes are committed with a clear message (see save-after-accomplishments rule).
2. **Push to git** – Run `git push origin main` (or the current branch). Vercel is connected to the repo and deploys on push.
3. **Do not** – Tell the user to “deploy to Vercel” or “push to trigger deploy” without actually running the push. Run the push so the deployment happens.

If the user asks how to deploy or says deployment is needed, run the push after commits are in place (and create commits if there are uncommitted changes).
