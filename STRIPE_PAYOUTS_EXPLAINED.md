# Stripe Payouts - How You Get Paid

## How Stripe Actually Works

**Stripe automatically deposits money into your bank account** - you don't manually withdraw.

## Two Options:

### Option 1: Automatic Payouts (Default)
- Stripe **automatically sends money** to your bank account
- You set the schedule: **Daily, Weekly, or Monthly**
- Most common: **Daily** (money arrives 2-7 days after customer pays)
- You don't do anything - it's automatic

### Option 2: Manual Payouts (Available)
- You can **disable automatic payouts** in Stripe Dashboard
- Money accumulates in your Stripe Balance
- You manually trigger payouts when you want
- Go to Stripe Dashboard → Balance → Payouts → "Pay out" button

## Your Stripe Balance Dashboard Shows:
- **Pending**: Money waiting to be sent (usually 2-7 days)
- **Available**: Money ready to be sent
- **In transit**: Money being sent to your bank
- **Paid**: Money that arrived in your bank

## How to Change Payout Settings:

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Click **Settings** → **Bank accounts and scheduling**
3. Choose your payout schedule:
   - **Daily** (recommended - money arrives faster)
   - **Weekly** (every Monday, for example)
   - **Monthly** (on a specific day)
   - **Manual** (you withdraw when you want)

## Summary:
- **Default**: Stripe auto-deposits daily (you don't withdraw manually)
- **You can change**: Set it to manual if you want to control when you get paid
- **Both options work** - it's just a preference
