---

- ❌ Cannot fetch real comments from platforms

- ❌ No team activity logs
- **Status:** Listed in pricing, but NOT built

**Competitors:** ✅ All have team features

**Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Can't sell to teams/agencies (even though it's in pricing)

---

### 5. **Mobile Apps** ❌ NOT BUILT
**What's Claimed:** Not claimed, but expected
**Reality:**

**Reality:**

- **Team features listed but not built** - Medium priority

### The Reality:
**CreatorFlow has MORE features, but competitors have BETTER core functionality.**

**It's like:**
- CreatorFlow: Swiss Army knife with 22 tools, but the main blade (posting) doesn't work
- Competitors: Simple knife, but it actually cuts (posts work)

---

- **CreatorFlow loses** - Team features are listed but don't exist

### For Pricing:
- **CreatorFlow wins** - Much cheaper ($5 vs $25-249)
