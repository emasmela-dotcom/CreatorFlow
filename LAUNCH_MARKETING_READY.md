# Launch With Marketing – Get Ready Today

**What this means:** The site is already live. “Launch with marketing” = ready to **send traffic to it, run ads, and look for clients** without worrying the site will embarrass you or drop signups. So: core flows work, trust/legal in place, one clear URL and CTA, and you’re ready to point people to it.

Use this list to get **done today** and ready to market.

## Do today (site ready for marketing)

| # | Task | Done |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | **One full signup test** – New email → Sign up → land on dashboard. No errors. | ☑ |
| 2 | **One pricing test** – From home or dashboard, hit a plan or “Get Started” → signup/checkout flow starts (or trial). No broken Stripe. | ☑ |
| 3 | **Stripe price check** – Stripe Dashboard prices match what the site shows (e.g. Starter $9, Essential $19, Creator $49, etc.). Price IDs in Vercel match. | ☑ |
| 4 | **One link you’ll use** – Decide and write down: “I send people to: ________” (e.g. `https://www.creatorflow365.com` or `/signup`). Use it everywhere. | ☑ |
| 5 | **Footer/legal** – Privacy and Terms pages load (not 404). Contact/support works (e.g. support@ or contact link). | ☑ |
| 6 | **Demo works** – Visit `/demo`, try without signup. No crash. | ☑ |
