## Recommendations

### Option 1: Add More Value to Justify $50 Jump

**Add to Agency Plan:**
- ✅ **All 25 tools unlocked** (if using tiered tool unlocking)
- ✅ **Advanced Social Listening** (competitor tracking, sentiment analysis)
- ✅ **Bulk Operations** (bulk post, bulk edit, bulk schedule)
- ✅ **Advanced Team Features** (workflows, approvals, roles)
- ✅ **Custom Branded Reports** (PDF exports with agency branding)
- ✅ **Priority Feature Requests** (Agency users get features first)
- ✅ **Monthly Strategy Sessions** (with account manager)
- ✅ **Custom Onboarding** (personalized setup)

### Option 2: Reduce Price Jump

**Make Agency $79/month** (+$30 instead of +$50)
- Still significant jump
- More palatable
- Better conversion rate

### Option 3: Add Intermediate Plan

**Add "Professional" at $69/month:**
- Business features
- Unlimited team (15 members)
- Partial white-label
- 4hr support
- No account manager

Then Agency at $99:
- Everything in Professional
- Full white-label
- Unlimited team
- Dedicated account manager
- 2hr support
