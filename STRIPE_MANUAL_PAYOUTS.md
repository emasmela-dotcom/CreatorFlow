## 💰 How Manual Payouts Work

### Money Flow:

   - Shows in Stripe Dashboard → **Balance**
   - Available for withdrawal anytime
   - **No automatic transfer**

   - Go to Stripe Dashboard → **Balance** → **Payouts**
   - Click **"Pay out funds"** or **"Transfer funds"**
   - Enter amount (or select "Pay out all available")
