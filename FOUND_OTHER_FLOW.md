# CreatorFlow365 – Other Flow Not Found in This Repo

The flow you see on creatorflow365.com (red “Not authenticated”, 7-day trial, Starter $9 / Essential $19 / Creator $79, pick-plan loop) is **not in this CreatorFlow repo**.

Searched this repo and the app code: no “Not authenticated” UI, no “7-day free trial” marketing copy, no “Essential” or “Creator” plan names or that pricing set.

So that flow is coming from somewhere else: another repo, branch, deploy, or service. To find it, use Vercel (which repo/branch is deployed for creatorflow365.com), View Source on the live page, or search your other projects for that text.
