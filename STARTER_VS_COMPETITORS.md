## How Starter differs from competitors

1. **More AI tools at the same or lower price**  
   Starter: **18 specialized bots** (content, repurposing, gap analysis, analytics coach, trend scout, scheduling, engagement, expense, invoice, email, meeting scheduler, etc.).  
   Competitors at $9–25: **1–5 tools**, mostly writing or basic scheduling.

2. **Content layer they don’t bundle at this price**  
   Starter: **Unlimited** documents, hashtag sets, templates; **content library search**; **content repurposing** across platforms.  
   Buffer/Later at entry: scheduling and basic analytics, not this content-creation + organization stack.

3. **Creator business tools**  
   Starter: **Expense tracker, invoice generator, email sorter, meeting scheduler, brand collaboration tracking.**  
   Competitors at $9–25: **None** of these; they’re social-only (or writing-only).

4. **Price vs what you get**  
   Starter: **$9** for 3 accounts + all of the above.  
   Later: **$25** for less tooling. Buffer: **~$18** for 3 channels with fewer tools. Hootsuite: **$99+** to get serious tooling.

5. **All-in-one for creators**  
   Starter = **content creation + organization + business tools** in one place at one price.  
   Competitors at similar price = either **writing-only** (e.g. Rytr) or **scheduling-only** (e.g. Buffer, Later), not the full creator stack.

## One-line summary

**Starter ($9) gives 18 AI bots, unlimited content tools (docs, hashtags, templates, repurposing, search), and creator business tools (expense, invoice, email, scheduling, collab)—at a price and scope competitors don’t match at their lowest tier.**
