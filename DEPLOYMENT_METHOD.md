# Deployment Method - Terminal Only ✅

## 🎯 ONE PLACE TO BUILD: Terminal

**We will ONLY use terminal for deployments. No Vercel dashboard needed.**

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy (Always Use This)

### Step 1: Make sure you're in the right directory
```bash
cd /Users/ericmasmela/CreatorFlow
```

### Step 2: Deploy to production
```bash
vercel --prod
```

**That's it!** This is the ONLY command you need.

---

## 📍 Your Production URL

After running `vercel --prod`, you'll see:
```
✅ Production: https://creatorflow-xxxxx.vercel.app
```

**This URL stays the same every time you deploy.**

---

## ✅ Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Run: `vercel --prod`
3. Get production URL
4. Done!

**No dashboard, no confusion, just one command.**

---

## 🔑 First Time Only

If you need to login:
```bash
vercel login
```
(Press ENTER, authorize in browser, then you're done)

After that, just use: `vercel --prod`

---

**This is your deployment method. Simple and consistent.**
