# Progressive Pricing Structure Proposal

## Philosophy
Start with a plan that's **barely better than manual work**, then progressively add value with each tier. Each upgrade should feel like a meaningful step up.

## Implementation Notes

- **AI bots** should have clear performance differences between tiers
- **Analytics** should scale from basic → advanced → premium → enterprise
- **Support** response times should be clearly different per tier
- **Team features** unlock at Business (not earlier - keeps it professional)
