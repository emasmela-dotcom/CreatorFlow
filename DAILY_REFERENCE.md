## 🚨 WHAT'S MISSING (CRITICAL)

- ❌ Cannot actually post to Facebook/Instagram/Twitter yet
- ❌ No real API integrations with social platforms
- **This is the most important thing to add next**

**Other Missing Features:**
- ❌ Mobile apps (iOS/Android) - but you CAN build these in cloud for free
- ❌ Real engagement inbox (comments/messages management)
- ❌ Social listening (track mentions/hashtags)

---

## 💵 COMPETITOR FACTS (PROOF OF MARKET)
- **Hootsuite:** $350M+ revenue in 2024
- **Buffer:** ~$23M annual revenue (2025)
- **Sprout Social:** Public company, actively traded
- **Market Size:** $6B in 2024, growing to $18B by 2030

**Key Insight:** Big market with proven demand. Your pricing is competitive.

---

## 🎁 YOUR ADVANTAGES (What Makes You Different)
1. **Creator-first** (competitors focus on brands/agencies)
2. **Post-based pricing** (they charge per account - more expensive)
3. **Lower entry point** ($19 vs competitors' $25-$99+)
5. **No 3-month lock-in** - content is immediately theirs after paying

---

## 📱 MOBILE APPS (Future)
**Can Build in Cloud for Free:**
- ✅ Codemagic: 500 free build minutes/month
- ✅ GitHub Actions: Free builds
- ✅ No need to use your Mac for building

**Required Costs (Can't Avoid):**
- ❌ Apple Developer: $99/year (to publish iOS)
- ❌ Google Play: $25 one-time (to publish Android)

**Can develop/test for FREE, only pay when ready to publish**

2. **Payment:** Stripe (live mode configured)

4. **Hosting:** Vercel (free tier)
5. **Content Policy:** Once paying member = content is theirs immediately

---
